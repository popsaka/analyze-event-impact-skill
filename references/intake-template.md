# Intake Template

Use this template when the user has not yet provided a strong reference frame. The goal is to move the conversation from `what happened` to `what may be mispriced`.

If the user has private research, internal notes, watchlists, or historical analogs, ask for the most relevant parts.

If the user has no private database, do not over-question them. A usable first-pass analysis can still be built from a small number of strong assumptions.

Tell the user:
- You do not need perfect answers.
- Fill in only what you know.
- If you are unsure, write `不确定` or `不知道`.
- A rough hypothesis is better than leaving the analysis unguided.


## Event confirmation first (mandatory)

Before analysis, confirm event status with live sources:
- A 已发生
- B 未发生（反事实）
- C 信息不足

Minimum evidence: 2 independent timestamped sources.
If retrieval fails, return C and stop directional call.

## Minimum guided questions

Ask only the questions needed for the task.

1. What is the event, and is it confirmed or still developing?
2. Which stage is it in: start, escalation, digestion, stabilization, or reversal?
3. Which asset, sector, or product are we analyzing?
4. What does the market seem to believe already?
5. Roughly how much of the bull or bear case do you think is already priced in?
6. Which variable do you think the market is underweighting or misreading?
7. What horizon matters: intraday, days, weeks, or structural?
8. Do you have any house view, watchlist, or analog case to load?

## Fast-fill version

Use this block if the user wants speed.

## Fast-fill version (Chinese)

Use this block for ordinary client conversations. Keep the tone light and low-pressure.

```text
事件是什么：
目前状态：
事件阶段：
相关资产：
你觉得市场现在在相信什么：
你觉得市场已经定价了多少：
你觉得市场可能忽视了什么：
你关心的时间范围：
可补充的私域资料/个人判断：
```

Suggested helper text:

```text
按你知道的填就行，不需要每一项都很完整。
如果某一项你不确定，可以直接写「不确定」或「不知道」。
如果你有自己的研究、聊天记录、行业资料、历史案例，也可以一起贴给我；没有也没关系，我可以先基于你的核心假设做第一轮分析。
```

## Minimal version for ordinary clients

Use this shorter block when the user does not have a knowledge base.

```text
Event:
Asset universe:
My core hypothesis:
What I think is already priced in:
What the market may be missing:
Time horizon:
```

## Minimal version for ordinary clients (Chinese)

```text
事件：
相关资产：
我的核心判断：
我觉得市场已经定价了什么：
我觉得市场可能忽视了什么：
我关心的时间范围：
```

Suggested helper text:

```text
只写你最确定的 2-3 点就可以。
没有资料库也没关系，只要告诉我你的核心看法，我就可以先帮你推演。
不确定的地方可以直接写「不确定」。
```

## If the user cannot answer fully

- Make the minimum reasonable assumptions.
- Label assumptions explicitly.
- Lower confidence.
- Spend more effort on alternative scenarios and falsifiers.
